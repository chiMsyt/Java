## Arrays vs. Collections

Arrays are fixed-size data structures that store elements of the same type. They provide fast access to elements but have a limited size. Collections, on the other hand, are dynamic and can grow or shrink as needed. They offer more flexibility and functionality, such as searching and sorting, but may have a performance overhead compared to arrays. In this project, arrays are used for simplicity and efficiency in storing a fixed number of grades.
